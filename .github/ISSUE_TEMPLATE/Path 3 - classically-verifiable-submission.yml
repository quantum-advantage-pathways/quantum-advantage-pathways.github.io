        ## âœ… Path 3 - Classically Verifiable Problems Pathway

        Thank you for submitting a solution to the **Classically Verifiable Problems** pathway!

        This pathway focuses on solutions that are hard to generate classically but easy to verify. Your submission should demonstrate quantum generation with efficient classical verification.

        Please provide detailed information about your submission below.
