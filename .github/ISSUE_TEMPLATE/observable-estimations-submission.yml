        ## ðŸ“Š Observable Estimations Pathway

        Thank you for submitting a solution to the **Observable Estimations** pathway!

        This pathway focuses on expectation-value experiments with mathematically grounded error bars. Your submission should demonstrate rigorous error control through QEC, QEM, or Post-Selected Error Detection.

        Please provide detailed information about your submission below.
