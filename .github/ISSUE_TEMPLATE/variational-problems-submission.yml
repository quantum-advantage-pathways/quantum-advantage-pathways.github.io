        ## ‚öõÔ∏è Variational Problems Pathway

        Thank you for submitting a solution to the **Variational Problems** pathway!

        This pathway focuses on guaranteed solution bounds and benchmarking against classical methods. Your submission should demonstrate variational bounds (energy values as upper bounds to true ground-state energy).

        Please provide detailed information about your submission below.
