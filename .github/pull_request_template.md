## Submission Summary

- **Pathway**: (select one) ☐ Path 1 · Observable ☐ Path 2 · Hamiltonians ☐ Path 3 · Peak Circuits
- **Problem ID**: `<problem_id>`
- **Submission type**: ☐ New claim ☐ Update to existing claim ☐ New problem instance

### Required Updates

Please confirm all relevant items have been completed before requesting review:

- [ ] Added or updated the submission entry in `data/paths/<path-id>/submissions.json`
- [ ] Included classical & quantum time and hardware details
- [ ] Linked to a reproducible method description (paper, code, or doc)
- [ ] Provided validation evidence matching the pathway requirements
- [ ] (If new circuit) Added the problem row in `data/paths/<path-id>/problems.json`
- [ ] Attached/updated the problem metadata JSON in `problems/<path>/<problem_id>.json`
- [ ] Attached/updated the circuit file in `problems/<path>/<problem_id>.qasm`
- [ ] Ran a local build/preview to confirm the tracker renders the new data
